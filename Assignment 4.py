1.  Write a program to determine the roots (just the real without the complex) of the quadratic
    equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 (where a != 0) after requesting the values of a, b, and c.
    Before finding the roots, ensure that a is nonzero.
    Note: The equation has 2, 1, or 0 solutions depending on whether the value of b2 â€“ 4ac is
    positive, zero, or negative. The solutions are given by the quadratic formula:
        x = (-b+-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a
